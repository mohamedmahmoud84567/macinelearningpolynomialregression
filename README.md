Practice implementing machine learning polynomial regression 
Get some practice implementing polynomial regression in this exercise. In datapoly.csv, you can see data generated for one predictor feature ('Var_X') and one outcome feature ('Var_Y'), following a non-linear trend. Use sklearn's PolynomialFeatures class to extend the predictor feature column into multiple columns with polynomial features. Play around with different degrees of polynomial.
